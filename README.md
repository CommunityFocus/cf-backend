# cf-backend
CommunityFocus is a sharable time tracking app for teams.

## Getting Started
To contribute:

1. Clone the backend and frontend repos (linked below).
2. Install nodejs (we will be using npm).
3. Open a terminal and `cd` into backend repo and run `npm i` and then `npm run dev`.
4. Open another terminal and `cd` into the frontend repo. Run `npm i` and then `npm run dev`.
5. PORT number will default to 4000 unless specified in the '.env' file. Otherwise, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` to open the app (temporary `http://127.0.0.1:4000/abc` to see timer).
